# Installers Summary

## Overview

This folder contains everything needed to install and run GeoPolitical Domination on any platform.

- **ONLY ONE FILE** to download and run
- NO other files, dependencies, or manual setup
- Automatic download from GitHub
- Automatic Python and dependency installation
- Automatic game setup and launch

### Mac/Linux: Permission denied
```
chmod +x gpd-setup-unix.sh
bash gpd-setup-unix.sh
```

### Installer won't find Python
- Python may not be in PATH
- Check: `python3 --version`
- Reinstall Python and check "Add to PATH"

### Dependencies won't install
- Check internet connection
- Try running installer again
- Check you have ~500 MB free disk space

### Game won't start after installation
- Try running the installer again
