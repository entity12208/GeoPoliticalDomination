## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Windows: The file won't run
- Make sure you downloaded it as `.cmd` file, not `.txt`
- Try right-clicking it and selecting "Run as administrator"
- If that doesn't work, open Command Prompt and drag the file into it

### Mac/Linux: Permission denied
Run this first:
```
chmod +x gpd-setup-unix.sh
bash gpd-setup-unix.sh
```

### Installation takes a very long time
- This is normal the first time (downloading and installing dependencies)
- Subsequent runs will be faster

### Game won't start
- Make sure you have internet connection (for initial download)
- Try running the installer again
- Check the detailed guide for your platform
