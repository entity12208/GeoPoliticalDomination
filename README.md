## How to Play

1. When you start the game, you'll see:
   - A world map
   - A "New Game" button
   - A slider to choose how many computer opponents you want

2. Click "New Game" and choose your starting country by clicking it on the map

3. On your turn, you have four choices:

   A) Peace (Green button)
   - Makes you vulnerable but earns money
   - Get $100 per country you own if nobody attacks you
   - Good for building up your treasury!

   B) Expand (Blue button)
   - Attack or claim nearby countries
   - Costs $200 to claim a country
   - Extra $100 cost to cross water, $200 to cross oceans
   - When attacking: You roll one 20-sided die, defender rolls two and uses the higher number
   - Winner takes the country!

   C) Gather Troops (Orange button)
   - Roll a die to see how many troops you can buy
   - Each troop costs $50
   - Troops are split among your countries
   - More troops = better defense and attack power

   D) Do Nothing (Red button)
   - Skip your turn
   - You won't be vulnerable
   - Use this if you can't or don't want to do anything else

## Tips for New Players

- Start by gathering troops and money
- Try to capture entire continents for bonus money:
  - Europe or Asia = $1000
  - North America = $800
  - South America, Central America, or Africa = $200
- Watch your money! Don't spend it all on troops
- Leave at least some troops in each country for defense
- If someone looks weak, that might be a trap (they might be in "Peace" mode)

## Troubleshooting

If the game won't start:
- Make sure you followed ALL the setup steps for your computer type
- Try closing and reopening your Terminal/PowerShell
- Make sure you're in the correct folder when running commands
- On Chromebook: Make sure Linux is fully installed and updated

If you see any error messages, try:
1. Closing the game
2. Opening Terminal/PowerShell again
3. Going to your game folder
4. Running the activate command for your computer
5. Running the game again



## Playing Online

To play with friends online, you'll need additional setup and a special file called `gpd_secrets.txt`. Ask the game maintainers for help setting this up - it requires some technical knowledge to configure properly.

Enjoy conquering the world! ðŸŒŽ
