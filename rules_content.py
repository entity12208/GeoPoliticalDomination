        # Overview
        "Welcome to GeoPolitical Domination, an engaging turn-based strategy game where players compete to dominate a global map through strategic territory control, military buildup, and calculated attacks. This game combines elements of classic risk-style gameplay with a fast-paced economic system that rewards both aggressive expansion and careful positioning.",

        "The fundamental goal of GeoPolitical Domination is simple: be the last player remaining on the map. To achieve this, you must claim territories, build your military forces, manage your economy, and outmaneuver your opponents through clever tactical decisions and strategic alliances.",

        "Unlike many strategy games that require hours of play, GeoPolitical Domination is designed to be fast-paced and accessible. Each turn offers meaningful choices and the potential for dramatic shifts in power. Games typically last 30-60 minutes depending on the number of players and their skill levels.",

        # Game Start
        "Before the game begins, each player selects a starting country from the available map. This country becomes your first territory at no cost. You begin with 1 troop stationed in this country, giving you a modest defensive presence from the very start. Your initial territory serves as your foothold on the map and should be chosen with an eye toward expansion opportunities.",

        "Every player starts with $500 in their treasury. This initial capital is crucial for your early expansion strategy. You must decide whether to spend aggressively on troops and territorial expansion in the early game, or to play conservatively and build up resources for a strong mid-game push. Your starting country is placed on the map immediately, and all other players can see your position right away.",

        # Turn Actions
        "Each turn in GeoPolitical Domination, you must choose exactly one of four actions. These actions form the core of gameplay and represent your strategic options each turn. You cannot combine actions, and you must choose something different to do each turn. Your choice will affect your military position, your economy, and your standing among opponents.",

        "ACTION 1: PEACE — This action allows you to enter a defensive posture and focus on economic growth rather than military expansion. When you choose Peace, your territories become vulnerable to attack, meaning any opponent who attacks your vulnerable territory will automatically win the battle without rolling dice. This is a high-risk position. However, if you successfully make it through your opponent's turns without being attacked, you earn $100 per territory you own, creating a substantial economic boost. For example, if you own 8 territories and no one attacks you, you'd gain $800, which could fund significant military buildup or expansion. Peace is best used when you're ahead in territory count or when you predict an opponent won't attack you.",

        "ACTION 2: EXPAND — This is your primary way to grow your empire. To expand, you select a source territory that you currently own and a target territory that you wish to claim. The target must be an unclaimed territory or a territory owned by another player (you cannot target your own territories). When expanding, you must pay two costs: a base claim cost of $200, plus a crossing fee that depends on the distance to the target. Nearby territories cost $100 to cross, while distant territories cost $300 to cross. After paying these costs, your troops from the source territory attack the target. The combat system uses dice rolls: your attacking troops roll 1d20 (one twenty-sided die), while the defending troops roll 2d20 and use their highest result. If your attack roll exceeds the defense roll, you win the territory and occupy it with the troops you sent. If you lose, your attacking troops are destroyed but the target territory remains claimed by the original owner.",

        "The dice-based combat system in Expand actions creates exciting moments of uncertainty. A lucky roll can overcome a numerical disadvantage, making it possible for smaller forces to defeat larger ones through sheer tactical luck. However, the defender's advantage (rolling two dice) means that defending territories are naturally harder to take than attacking, encouraging thoughtful positioning.",

        "ACTION 3: GATHER — When you choose to Gather, you purchase additional troops to strengthen your military position. New troops cost $50 each, and you can buy as many as your budget allows. However, the game imposes a random purchase limit each turn: you can only buy between 1 and 20 troops, chosen randomly each time you Gather. This prevents any single player from building an unstoppable army through sheer economic dominance. Once purchased, your new troops are automatically distributed evenly across all your territories. For example, if you buy 9 troops and own 3 territories, each territory gains 3 new troops. This automatic distribution means you cannot concentrate forces in one territory through pure gathering.",

        "ACTION 4: NOTHING — You can choose to skip your turn and take no action. This might seem like a waste, but it can be strategically valuable in certain situations. Perhaps you want to preserve cash for a critical Expand action next turn, or you're waiting to see what other players do before committing resources. While Nothing seems passive, it can be part of a larger strategic plan.",

        # Economy
        "Money is the lifeblood of GeoPolitical Domination. You start with $500 and earn money through two primary methods: Peace payouts and continent bonuses. Managing your treasury is critical to long-term success. Rich players can afford aggressive expansion while poor players must play defensively or find clever ways to earn bonuses.",

        "You earn money passively through Peace payouts when you survive a turn without being attacked. This is the main economic engine for players who own many territories. As mentioned, each territory generates $100 during a successful Peace turn. If you own the entire African continent (6 territories) and choose Peace, you could earn $600 plus any continent bonus if you just completed Africa.",

        "Continent bonuses are massive one-time payouts for capturing every single country in a continent. These bonuses are the most significant economic boost in the game and should be a major strategic goal. Europe and Asia are worth $1000 each, making them extremely attractive targets. North America is worth $800, Africa is worth $400, South America is worth $350, and Central America is worth $200. Some continents are easier to complete than others, but all continents present strategic value.",

        "Your financial decisions each turn will determine your trajectory through the game. A player who uses Peace strategically when they have a territorial advantage can generate enormous wealth. A player who constantly attacks without considering economic consequences may win battles but lose the war through bankruptcy.",

        # Elimination and Victory
        "If you lose all your territories through successful attacks by other players, you are eliminated from the game. You cannot claim new territories or perform any actions. Instead, you transition to spectator status. Spectators can observe the game state, watch the map, see other players' actions, and chat with other spectators (depending on the game mode). While being eliminated is disappointing, you can continue to enjoy the game as a spectator and perhaps discuss strategy or prediction with other eliminated players.",

        "Victory in GeoPolitical Domination goes to the last player standing. When all other players have been eliminated, you are declared the winner. There is no score-based victory or secondary victory condition: it is purely about being the sole surviving player. Some games may end before true elimination if players agree to negotiate peace, but the default objective is total domination.",

        "Spectating is an important part of the social experience. Eliminated players remain connected to the game and can see what happens in the endgame. If a game has a player join mid-game, that player may also start as a spectator and enter the game when an active slot opens up, or they may watch the full game depending on settings chosen by the host.",

        # Hosting
        "The host of a GeoPolitical Domination game has special responsibilities and powers. The host can kick players from the game lobby before the game starts if they need to manage the player roster or remove disruptive players. The host can also set a maximum player limit to control game size. Game size significantly affects pacing and strategy, so choosing the right player limit is important. Smaller games (2-4 players) play quickly and allow for more careful planning. Larger games (5+ players) involve more chaos and unpredictability as multiple players compete.",

        # Map and Visibility
        "GeoPolitical Domination is played on a world map showing all countries and continents. The specific map view depends on the game mode and settings. Some games use the full world map, while others use single-continent maps like 'Europe Only' or 'Asia Only'. Single-continent games play faster and are ideal for quick rounds. The world map offers more strategic depth and longer, more competitive games.",

        # Advanced Strategy
        "Territory control generates economic value through Peace payouts and continent bonuses, making it a priority objective. However, holding too much territory without sufficient troops makes you vulnerable to attacks. Balancing expansion with military development is the key to success. Early game is typically focused on claiming territories and avoiding major conflicts while you build up resources.",

        "Identifying which continent to complete first is a crucial strategic decision. Some players prefer to rush Africa (6 countries, smaller bonus) to get early cash. Others target Europe or Asia (larger bonuses) despite the increased difficulty and competition. Your starting position heavily influences which continent is most accessible.",

        "The dice-based combat system means that strategic luck plays a role, but so does positioning. By expanding into adjacent territories, you gain multiple angles of attack against enemies and force them to defend more spread out. Clustering your territories together creates defensible positions.",
    ],

    "classic": [
        "Classic Mode is the standard, most accessible way to play GeoPolitical Domination. It is designed to be straightforward and fun without adding special restrictions or complications. If you're new to the game, Classic Mode is where you should start to learn the basics and understand how all the core systems interact.",

        "In Classic Mode, all territories on the map are visible to all players at all times. You can see exactly how many troops are stationed in each territory, regardless of ownership. You can see your opponents' positions clearly and make informed decisions about where to attack and where to defend. This complete information transparency removes the fog of war and makes the game more about tactical execution than information discovery.",

        "Complete visibility in Classic Mode means that players can predict each other's moves to some degree. If you see an opponent has concentrated all their troops in one country, you know they are vulnerable in their other territories. If you see a continent nearly completed, you know that completing it yourself will be difficult. This transparency rewards players who can interpret the map state accurately.",

        "Chat is fully enabled during Classic Mode games. Players can communicate, negotiate, form temporary alliances, trash talk, and discuss strategy in real-time. Chat creates a social experience and allows for diplomacy. Players might agree to not attack each other for a few turns, or coordinate to take down a mutual threat, or simply joke around while playing.",

        "Game logs in Classic Mode are visible to all players. You can scroll through the history and see every action taken by every player. This includes all Expand actions, Gather actions, Peace declarations, and Nothing turns. Logs provide a complete narrative of the game and allow players to understand how the current state developed. If you weren't paying attention, you can check the logs to catch up.",

        "There is no turn timer in Classic Mode. You can take as long as you need to decide your action each turn. This removes time pressure and allows for thoughtful decision-making. Games may take longer than in other modes, but the pace remains reasonable because other players are waiting for you to decide.",

        "Classic Mode is available on the full world map as well as on individual continent maps. The world map offers complex, long-lasting games with many possible strategies. Continent maps compress the action and create fast, tactical games. Both options are excellent ways to enjoy Classic Mode.",

        "Classic Mode is perfect for casual play with friends, learning the game mechanics, or enjoying a standard competitive round without special restrictions. It strikes a balance between accessibility and strategic depth, making it the most widely played mode in GeoPolitical Domination.",

        "The straightforward rules of Classic Mode create an environment where player skill, decision-making, and luck with dice rolls are the primary determinants of victory. There are no special mechanics to learn, no hidden information to track, and no time pressure to manage. You can focus entirely on strategy.",

        "Many veteran players return to Classic Mode even after mastering other modes because of its pure, streamlined gameplay. There's something satisfying about a well-executed territorial conquest strategy or an unexpected lucky dice roll that turns the tide of battle. Classic Mode never gets old.",
    ],

    "tournament": [
        "Tournament Mode is designed for serious competitive play and represents the highest level of strategic challenge in GeoPolitical Domination. If you've mastered Classic Mode and want a true test of your skills, Tournament Mode will push your abilities to the limit.",

        "The defining feature of Tournament Mode is FOG OF WAR. This mechanic fundamentally changes how you play the game. You can only see troop counts on territories that you own. You can also see troop counts on territories that are adjacent to your territories, allowing you to see the immediate neighbors of your empire. All other territories show a question mark (?) in place of the troop count, hiding the enemy's military strength.",

        "Territory ownership colors remain visible in Tournament Mode, so you can still see who owns what. However, without troop counts for distant territories, you cannot determine the strength of enemy positions unless they are right next to you. This creates a fog of war where you must explore the map to gather intelligence on enemy forces. Scouting through expansion becomes a crucial strategic element.",

        "The fog of war mechanic dramatically increases the strategic depth of Tournament Mode. You can no longer make perfectly informed decisions about where to attack because you don't know the enemy's military strength. A territory might have 1 troop or 20 troops, and you won't know until you scout. This creates opportunities for bold bluffs and risky attacks, as well as careful, methodical scouting strategies.",

        "Chat is completely disabled in Tournament Mode. Players cannot communicate with each other during the game. This removes the social element and any possibility of forming alliances or negotiating peace. Every player is purely focused on their own dominance. The silence creates an intensely focused competitive environment.",

        "Game logs are hidden from players in Tournament Mode. You cannot scroll through the history to see what actions were taken. This means you must rely on your memory and game sense to track what other players have been doing. Did that opponent Gather twice in a row? You'll only know if you remember it. This further increases the value of careful attention and strategic thinking.",

        "Tournament Mode uses a TURN TIMER to keep games moving at a reasonable pace. Each player has exactly 10 minutes of total time for ALL their turns combined throughout the entire game. A countdown timer displays your remaining time. If you run out of time, all your remaining turns automatically execute as NOTHING, giving your opponents a free turn to attack you with impunity.",

        "The 10-minute timer creates intense pressure in Tournament Mode. You must make quick decisions and cannot afford to overthink every move. This rewards players who can think fast and who have internalized the game's strategy deeply. Newer players often struggle with the time limit, while experienced players thrive under the pressure.",

        "Scouting adjacent territories becomes a core strategy in Tournament Mode. By expanding to neighbors, you not only grow your territory count but also reveal their troop strengths. A well-executed scouting campaign gives you crucial intelligence about where you can push your advantage and where you should retreat.",

        "Tournament Mode is available on both world maps and single-continent maps. Continent maps create even faster games where players must make critical decisions under intense time pressure in a smaller space. World map tournament games are longer but remain intense throughout.",

        "Victory in Tournament Mode feels more earned than in other modes because of the additional constraints. To win, you must not only make good strategic decisions but also manage your time effectively, maintain accurate mental models of the map state, and adapt to the fog of war. Tournament players are the true masters of GeoPolitical Domination.",

        "Tournament Mode attracts competitive players and is used for ranked play and tournaments in the GeoPolitical Domination community. If you want bragging rights for being a skilled player, you need to win in Tournament Mode.",
    ],

    "challenge": [
        "Challenge Mode, also known as Blindfolded Mode, is the ultimate test of memory, intuition, and strategic thinking in GeoPolitical Domination. This mode removes even more information than Tournament Mode, creating a nearly surreal gameplay experience where you must play almost entirely from memory.",

        "In Challenge Mode, the map appears completely blank to you. All territories show as unclaimed, with no colors to indicate ownership. You cannot see which territories belong to you, which belong to opponents, or which are still unclaimed. The map appears as a neutral, colorless field of countries. This creates the BLIND MODE mechanic that gives Challenge Mode its distinctive identity.",

        "You also cannot see any troop counts in Challenge Mode, similar to the fog of war in Tournament Mode. Where Tournament Mode lets you see your own troops and adjacent troops, Challenge Mode hides all troop information. The map is simply a visual reference of geography with no game data overlaid.",

        "Without visual information about territory ownership or troop counts, you must rely entirely on your memory and your game logs to understand the current state of the game. You must remember which territories you have claimed, which territories are owned by which opponents, where you have concentrated troops, and where your enemies might be vulnerable. This creates an incredibly challenging but rewarding gameplay experience.",

        "Game logs in Challenge Mode ARE visible, and they are your primary source of information about game state. The logs show which player performed which action, often including continent names and target information. By carefully reading the logs, you can reconstruct the map state in your mind. The logs become a critical strategic tool that you must monitor constantly.",

        "Chat IS enabled in Challenge Mode, creating an interesting dynamic where players can bluff about their positions and strength. Someone might claim to control a continent they don't actually own, or might claim to have only 2 troops when they have 10. Players listening to chat must decide what to believe based on the logs and their own memory. Bluffing becomes a viable strategy.",

        "Challenge Mode has no turn timer, giving you unlimited time to make decisions. You will need this time to carefully read the logs, reconstruct the map in your mind, and make thoughtful strategic decisions. The pace is slower than Tournament Mode because of the additional cognitive load.",

        "Challenge Mode is available on both world maps and single-continent maps. Single-continent Challenge Mode is slightly easier because there are fewer territories to track. World map Challenge Mode is substantially harder because you must maintain a mental model of 42+ countries and their ownership and troop counts.",

        "Strategy in Challenge Mode focuses heavily on continent completion and log reading. You should aim to complete continents because they generate large bonuses, and you should be constantly referencing the logs to understand what happened. A strong memory and attention to detail are more valuable than in any other mode.",

        "Players who excel at Challenge Mode often employ memory techniques like mentally dividing the map into regions or creating associations between player names and colors they started with. Over the course of a game, you build up an increasingly accurate mental model of the map state.",

        "The psychological challenge of playing with no visual information is part of what makes Challenge Mode unique. You will often experience moments of uncertainty and second-guessing as you question whether your memory of the map is accurate. This uncertainty is part of the fun and challenge.",

        "Challenge Mode attracts players who enjoy puzzle-like challenges and tests of mental prowess. If you can win Challenge Mode consistently, you truly understand the strategic depth of GeoPolitical Domination. It is the mode for mastery.",

        "Many players find Challenge Mode to be the most intellectually demanding and satisfying version of the game, despite being the most frustrating to learn. Once you adapt to playing blind, you'll discover strategies and insights that aren't even possible in other modes.",
